# Flight Delays and Cancellations Dashboard

### 📄 **Project Overview**

This project uses **Tableau** to analyze and visualize flight delays, cancellations, and diversions in the U.S. airline industry (2019–2023). It provides actionable insights for **airline managers** and **operational analysts** to optimize schedules, reduce delays, and improve customer experience. Data was sourced from the U.S. Department of Transportation and preprocessed using **Python**.

### 🚀 **Key Features**

1. **Interactive Dashboards**:
   * Monthly delay trends with toggles for arrival and departure delays.
   * Heatmaps and bar charts for cancellations and diversions by airline.
   * Geo-spatial maps for delays across U.S. states.
2. **Advanced Tableau Techniques**:
   * **Custom Calculations**: Cancellation rates, diversion percentages, and total delays.
   * **Dynamic Filters**: Drill down by year, month, state, and airline.
   * **Parameters**: Toggle between delay types and explore top delay-prone states.
3. **Visualized Insights**:
   * Seasonal delay patterns (July and December as peak months).
   * High-delay airlines (e.g., JetBlue Airways, Allegiant Air).
   * Regional hotspots for delays (e.g., New York and New Jersey).

### 📊 **Analysis Highlights**

* **Delay Trends**:
  * Significant seasonal delays during summer and holiday periods.
  * Reduced delays in 2020 due to pandemic-related travel restrictions.
* **Airline Comparisons**:
  * Identified airlines with consistently high cancellation/diversion rates.
  * Benchmarked low-delay carriers for best practices.
* **Regional Insights**:
  * High delay concentrations in densely populated regions and major hubs.

### 🛠 **Tools Used**

* **Tableau**: For dashboard design and data visualization.
* **Python (Google Colab)**: Data preprocessing and cleaning.
* **Geo-spatial Analysis**: Mapping delays by state and identifying regional trends.
